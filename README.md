# password-generator-with-python
Hello, this is my first project in the first year of CS degree. Hopefully I will be consistent to learn more about CS.


This program will generate random password with 20 characters length. I recommend to use the newest version of python (e.g python 3.0+)


command:

python3 password_generator.py


Thanks.


Feel free to modify my code, if you found bugs instead.
