# password-generator-with-python
Hello, this is my first project in the first year of CS degree. Hopefully I will be consistent to learn more about CS.


This program will generate random password with 20 characters length. To use this program, make sure you already installed the required tools (look at requirements.txt).


Other requirements:
-python 3+


command:

pip install requirements.txt

python3 main.py


Make sure to put those 2 files (requirements.txt and main.py) in the same folder to make it easier to run.


Thanks.
